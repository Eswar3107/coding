 int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int res = x ^ y;                       As we can see, XOR result is "1" only when there is a difference in bit for both inputs. This goes exactly with what our problem asked for.
                                                Next we just need to count the number of differences.
        int ans = 0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<32; ++i) {
            if ( (1<<i) & res ) {            As an int is 32 bit long, we just loop through each bit and check if that is a "1".And if so, we increment our ans.
                ++ans;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
